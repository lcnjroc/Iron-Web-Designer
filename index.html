            <p>I couldn't figure out the Python code for the bar graph or how to get it to work on my PC however I do know that Australia as a country in total won 12 medals before 2014 in the Winter Olympics.</p>

             	<p>The 3 Pie graphs above clearly show us how Canada is devastating Australia in over medals. Australia has only 15 medals compared to Canada's impressive medal count of 625. Unfortunately Australia has alot of catching up to do if they want to beat there friendly northern buddies.</p>
